# Debugging Activity
This assignment was the hardest of all. In this project, I had to debug three of the different checkpoints provided. I chose the first three just because they were the first ones I read. For the first checkpoint, I had to debug a program that was locked into an infinite loop. The program had to exit the loop after counting down from 5 to 1. For the second checkpoint, an error message kept showing up in the console. The final goal was to print out a student ID for each student in the console and the ID numbers should be from 0 to 4. For the third and final assignment, I had to check and make sure that the function provided was reading the passed parameters as it displayed "Nan" in the console. Although it was a great learning experience, this project definetely proved to be tough for my coding skills.
