# Creating Sentences Activity
In this project, I had to create a function called "createSentence" that would take an array as an argument. After that, I had to use a for loop to iterate through each word element of the array. Then, I had to add each word to the "sentence" variable that was made in the beginning. Finally, I would have to return the "sentence" variable.Although I struggled at first, I was able to finalize this coding project as I used my function notes and the cheat sheet provided by the instructor. I really enjoyed this assignment as it taught me how functions can help join together new things from an array.
