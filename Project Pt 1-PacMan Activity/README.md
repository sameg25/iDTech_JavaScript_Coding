# Project Pt 1 - PacMan Activity
This assignment was probably the most satifsactory as it took me a while to complete it. In this project, I was supposed to fix an animation of a pacman who is going across the screen. The problem with the animation was that the pacman did not switch around when hitting the edge of the screen. So, I had to fix the function in which the pacman would hit the edge of the screen, turn around and move from right to left. For this assignment, the use of if statements was very much used as it helped create the code needed in order to make the animation work properly.
