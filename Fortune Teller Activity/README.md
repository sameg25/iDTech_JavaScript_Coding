# Fortune Teller Activity
In this assignment, you will need to set equal a fortune to a number and use if statements to create a fortune teller game. If the fortune is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 3, then you have a low fortune. If the fortune is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 7, then you have an average fortune. If fortune is greater than 7 and less than or equal to 10, then you have a good fortune. If the fortune is out of range, then the fortune can't be read correctly. In this assignment I was able to really grasp the concept of if statements and using different conditions in order to achieve the goal of the project.
